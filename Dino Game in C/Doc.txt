Dino Game in C

The Dino game is a simple hurdle-based game. In this game a dinosaur has to jump hurdles, if the dinosaur successfully jumps a hurdle, the score point is incremented by one. And if the dinosaur hits the hurdle then the Game is Over.

Approach for Game

The dinosaur is represented by ASCII art and moves up and down to simulate jumping.
Obstacles move from right to left, and the dinosaur must jump over them.
The game speed increases over time, making it challenging.
If the dinosaur hits an obstacle, the game displays a "Game Over" message and waits for a key press.

Libraries Used

<stdio.h>: Standard Input/Output functions like printf.
<conio.h>: Console Input/Output functions, mainly used for getch() and kbhit().
<time.h>: Provides functions to work with time, used for the delay function.
<windows.h>: Provides functions for interacting with Windows OS, used for console manipulation.

Functions

moveTo(int x, int y): Moves the console cursor to the specified coordinates (x, y).
pause(unsigned int milliseconds) It introduces a delay in the program execution. The delay is implemented using the clock() function.
displayGameInfo(): It sets up the initial game screen by clearing the console, displays the controls, and initializes the display of the score.
displayCharacter(int jumpType): It displays the dinosaur at a specific height, simulating a jump.
displayObstacle(): It draws and moves the obstacles on the screen. If the dinosaur collides with any obstacle, the game over message is shown and the game is finished at this point.
